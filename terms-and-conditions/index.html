            <h2>3. Use License</h2>
            <p>
              Permission is granted for personal use according to your
              subscription plan. This is a grant of a license, not a transfer of
              title. Under this license, you may not:

            <ul>
              <li>Modify or copy the materials</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>4. Limitations</h2>
            <p>
              In no event shall MedScan AI or its suppliers be liable for any
              damages arising from the use or inability to use the application,

            <h2>6. Subscription and Payments</h2>
            <p>
              Payment Processing: We use Stripe for payment processing and
              subscription management. Payments can be made on a monthly or
              annual basis according to our published pricing plans.
            </p>

            <h3>Subscription Terms</h3>
            <p>The following terms apply to subscriptions:</p>

            </ul>

            <h3>Refund Policy</h3>
            <p>
              All payments are final and non-refundable. All payments are final
              and non-refundable, as each interpretation request incurs
              immediate computational costs. However, we prioritize fairness and
              customer satisfaction. If you suspect an error, please contact our
              support team.
            </p>

            <h3>Automatic Renewal</h3>
            <p>
              Subscriptions automatically renew unless canceled at least 24
              hours before the renewal date through your device's subscription
              management settings.
            </p>

            <h2>8. Governing Law and Jurisdiction</h2>
            <p>

              the laws of Romania. Any legal action or proceeding arising out of
              these Terms shall be brought exclusively in the courts of Romania.
